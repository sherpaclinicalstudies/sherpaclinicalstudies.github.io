The website is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) in the backend.  To run locally, clone the rep, install Jekyll, and run via `jekyll serve`.

It is using [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) as a base CSS framework to provide responsiveness in mobile.

The main content can be found in [index.html](index.html).  Custom CSS in [style.css](css/style.css).  Custom JS in [main.js](js/main.js).

Visitors who sign up for the mailing list are persisted to [Parse](http://parse.com) via the custom JS in [main.js](js/main.js).

Before updating, be sure website renders well in desktop, table, and mobile views.  This can be done with [Google Chrome Device Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode).
